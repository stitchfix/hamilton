# Integrating Decorators

This follows up on the [quick start](../less-than-15-minutes-to-mastery/) section.

Hamilton relies on[ python decorators](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-simplest-tutorial-for-python-decorator-dadbf8f20b0f) to enable easy code reuse. Taking the previous example, let's say that we cared about the running average spend per signup with both a 2 and a 3 week lookback. Rather than writing a bunch of functions with almost exactly the same definitions, we can parametrize! The following uses two decorator to [curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) your nodes into multiple functions.

{% code title="with_decorators.py" %}
```python
import pandas as pd

from hamilton.function_modifiers import parameterize
from hamilton.function_modifiers import value, source


@parameterize(
    avg_2wk_spend={'rolling_lookback' : value(2)},
    avg_3wk_spend={'rolling_lookback' : value(3)} 
)
def avg_nwk_spend(spend: pd.Series, rolling_lookback: int) -> pd.Series:
    """Average marketing spend looking back {rolling_lookback} weeks."""
    return spend.rolling(rolling_lookback).mean()


@parameterize(
    acquisition_cost_2wk={'spend' : source('avg_2wk_spend')},
    acquisition_cost_3wk={'spend' : source('avg_3wk_spend')}
)
def acquisition_cost(spend: pd.Series, signups: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    """The cost per signup in relation to {spend}."""
    return spend / signups
```
{% endcode %}

In this case we have two separate parameterizations:

1. Parameterizing the value (currying the function) for lookback
2. Parameterizing the source of the variable spend in acquisition\_cost

All we have to do is modify our driver to run the right module and ask for the right outputs, and we're good to go!

{% code title="driver.py" %}
```python
import logging
import sys

import pandas as pd

import with_decorators  # we import the module here!
from hamilton import driver

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Instantiate a common spine for your pipeline
    index = pd.date_range("2022-01-01", periods=6, freq="w")
    initial_columns = {  # load from actuals or wherever -- this is our initial data we use as input.
        # Note: these do not have to be all series, they could be scalar inputs.
        'signups': pd.Series([1, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400], index=index),
        'spend': pd.Series([10, 10, 20, 40, 40, 50], index=index),
    }
    # we need to tell hamilton where to load function definitions from
    dr = driver.Driver(initial_columns, with_decorators)  # can pass in multiple modules
    # we need to specify what we want in the final dataframe.
    output_columns = [
        'spend',
        'signups',
        'acquisition_cost_2wk',
        'acquisition_cost_3wk',
    ]
    # let's create the dataframe!
    df = dr.execute(output_columns)
    # `pip install sf-hamilton[visualization]` earlier you can also do
    # dr.visualize_execution(output_columns,'./my_dag.dot', {})
    print(df)
```
{% endcode %}

Running the driver now gives you the following:

```
   spend  signups  acquisition_cost_2wk  acquisition_cost_3wk
0     10        1                   NaN                   NaN
1     10       10                1.0000                   NaN
2     20       50                0.3000              0.266667
3     40      100                0.3000              0.233333
4     40      200                0.2000              0.166667
5     50      400                0.1125              0.108333
```
