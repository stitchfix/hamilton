# Available Graph Adapters

Use `from hamilton import base` to use these Graph Adapters:

|                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| base.SimplePythonDataFrameGraphAdapter | This executes the Hamilton dataflow locally on a machine in a single threaded, single process fashion. It assumes a pandas dataframe as a result.                                                       | This is the default GraphAdapter that Hamilton uses. Use this when you want to execute on a single machine, without parallelization, and you want a pandas dataframe as output.                                      |
| base.SimplePythonGraphAdapter          | This executes the Hamilton dataflow locally on a machine in a single threaded, single process fashion. It allows you to specify a ResultBuilder to control the return type of what `execute()` returns. | This is the default GraphAdapter that Hamilton uses. Use this when you want to execute on a single machine, without parallelization, and you want to control the return type of the object that `execute()` returns. |

## Experimental Graph Adapters

The following are considered experimental; there is a possibility of their API changing. That said, the code is stable, and you should feel comfortable giving the code for a spin - let us know how it goes, and what the rough edges are if you find any.

Use `from hamilton.experimental import h_[NAME]` to use these Graph Adapters:

| h\_dask.DaskGraphAdapter         | <p>This walks the graph and translates it to run onto <a href="https://dask.org/">Dask</a>. <br><br>You have the ability to pass in a ResultMixin object to the constructor to control the return type that gets produce by running on Dask.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Use this if you want to utilize multiple cores on a single machine, or you want to scale to large data set sizes with a Dask cluster that you can connect to.                                                                                                                        |
| h\_ray.RayGraphAdapter           | <p>This walks the graph and translates it to run onto <a href="https://ray.io/">Ray</a>. <br><br>You have the ability to pass in a ResultMixin object to the constructor to control the return type that gets produce by running on Ray.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Use this if you want to utilize multiple cores on a single machine, or you want to scale to larger data set sizes with a Ray cluster that you can connect to. Note: you are still constrained by machine memory size with Ray; you can't just scale to any dataset size.             |
| h\_spark.SparkKoalasGraphAdapter | <p>This walks the graph and translates it to run onto <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> using the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html">Pandas API on Spark</a> (aka <a href="https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Koalas</a>). <br><br>You only have the ability to return either a Koalas Dataframe or a Pandas Dataframe. To do that you either use the stock base.PandasDataFrameResult ResultMixin, or you use the <code>h_spark.KoalasDataframeResult</code> class.</p> | <p>You'd generally use this if you have an existing spark cluster running in your workplace, and you want to scale to very large data set sizes.<br><br>Note this GraphAdapter has only been tested to work on Spark 3.2+ when Koalas became part of the standard Spark library.</p> |
