# Installing

## Requirements

Hamilton is a lightweight framework with a variety of extensions/plugins. To get started, you'll need the following:

* [ ] `python >= 3.7`
* [ ] `pip`

For help with python/pip/managing virtual environments see the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

## **Installing**

Hamilton is published on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sf-hamilton/1.1.1/) under `sf-hamilton` (`hamilton` was already taken). To install, run:

`pip install sf-hamilton`

To use the DAG visualization functionality, instead install with&#x20;

`pip install sf-hamilton[visualization]`

``Note: for visualization you may additionally need to install `graphviz` externally -- see`` [`https://graphviz.org/download/`](https://graphviz.org/download/) `for instructions on the correct way for your operating system.`
